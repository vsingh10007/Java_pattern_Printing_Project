# Java Pattern Printing Project (GUI-Based)

This is a GUI-based Java application created for a college project. It allows users to select from a list of patterns, provide a size/limit, and print the desired pattern accordingly.

This project helps demonstrate logic building using loops and conditionals in Java, combined with simple GUI functionality using `JOptionPane`.

## 📌 Project Description
